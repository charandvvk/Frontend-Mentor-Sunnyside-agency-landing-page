# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

![Design preview for the Sunnyside agency landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my approach to this front-end coding challenge. You can see my code in action [here](https://charandvvk.github.io/Frontend-Mentor-Sunnyside-agency-landing-page/).

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But it could also be done without JS!

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. ( I used Bootstrap )

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. There is a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format.

All the required assets are in the `/images` folder.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information such as color palette and fonts.
